Metrics from Pivotal Cloud Foundry will begin streaming into SignalFx. 

##<a id='troubleshooting'></a> Troubleshooting Tips

If metrics from Pivotal Cloud Foundry don't appear in SignalFx after more than a few minutes, check the following:

* Verify that the values in the **Pivotal JMX Bridge** settings section of the SignalFx tile match the settings of the JMX Bridge tile.
* Check the logs of the deployed SignalFx Agent for errors, such as connection issues to the JMX Bridge, SSL certificate errors with the JMX Bridge, or errors reporting metrics to SignalFx. 
* Ensure that the app called **signalfx-agent** is running. 
  1. Log into [Pivotal Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/console-login.html). 
  1. Inside the space **signalfx-agent-space** there will be an app named **signalfx-agent**. 
  1. Ensure that signalfx-agent is in the "running" state.
