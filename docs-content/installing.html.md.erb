##<a id='troubleshooting'></a> Troubleshooting Tips

If metrics data is not appearing in SignalFx, check the following:

* Ensure that the values in the **Pivotal JMX Bridge** configuration section of the SignalFx tile match the configuration of the JMX Bridge tile.
* Check the logs of the deployed SignalFx Agent for errors, such as connection issues to the JMX Bridge, SSL certificate errors with the JMX Bridge, or errors reporting metrics to SignalFx. 
* Ensure that the app called **signalfx-agent** is running. 
** Log into [Pivotal Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/console-login.html). 
** Inside the space **signalfx-agent-space** there will be an app named **signalfx-agent**. 
** Ensure that signalfx-agent is in the "running" state.
