This topic describes how to install and configure the SignalFx Bridge.

##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure the SignalFx Bridge

1. Download the product file from Pivotal Network.

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of SignalFx Bridge.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly added **SignalFx Bridge** tile.

1. In the **Bridge Config** section, enter your SignalFx [access
token](http://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/tokens.html#tokens). Leave the SignalFx ingestion URL unchanged
(blank).

1. Fill in the other required fields.  You will need a UAA client account for both the CF API and the BOSH Director.
See [the SignalFx Bridge Github repo](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-cloudfoundry-bridge) for more information on
these config values.  The envvars under the *Configuration* section in the README of that repo correspond directly to
the values in the Tile config page in Ops Manager.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to install the SignalFx Bridge tile.
After installation completes, a message appears stating that the changes have been applied.

Metrics from Pivotal Cloud Foundry will begin streaming into SignalFx.

##<a id='troubleshooting'></a> Troubleshooting Tips

If metrics from Pivotal Cloud Foundry don't appear in SignalFx after more than a few minutes, check the following:

* Verify that the SignalFx Bridge VM has access through your firewall to the BOSH Director API and Cloud Foundry APIs.
* Check the logs of the deployed SignalFx Bridge for errors, such as connection issues to the CF or BOSH APIs, credential issues with either of those services, or errors reporting metrics to SignalFx (e.g. invalid access token, firewall preventing outbound connections).
