### v0.10.2

**Release Date:** June 27, 2017

 - Internally, SignalFx Monitoring and Alerting for PCF now refers to the PCF Operations Manager by hostname instead of by IP address.
  This corrects an issue where the tile could not communicate with the Ops Manager Director.

### v0.10.1

**Release Date:** June 15, 2017

 - Correcting a few metric types
 - Scrubbing credentials from logs
 - Tweaking dimensions for app metadata

### v0.10.0

**Release Date:** June 1, 2017

Revamped integration that is now a BOSH release wrapped in a tile instead of a Garden app.  We no longer use the JMX
Bridge, so it can be uninstalled if not used for anything else.  We also now send container metrics.

### v0.9.1

**Release Date:** May 12, 2017

Due to CVE-2017-4975, this is a rerelease of v0.9.0 to ensure that the new tile
generator is used when building the tile.

### v0.9.0

**Release Date:** March 31, 2017

This is the initial release of the SignalFx Monitoring and Alerting for PCF. Use this integration to 
monitor the health and performance of your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment using SignalFx. This integration
connects to the Pivotal JMX Bridge, retrieves metrics about your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment, and sends them to SignalFx.
