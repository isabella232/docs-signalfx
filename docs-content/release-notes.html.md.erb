### v0.11.2

**Release Date:** November 10, 2017

 - Enables explicit proxy configuration in tile settings
 - Special handling of BOSH HM Forwarder metrics to strip off the "bosh-hm-forwarder." prefix so that metric names match what the SignalFx BOSH HM listener sends.

### v0.10.2

**Release Date:** June 27, 2017

 - Internally, SignalFx Monitoring and Alerting for PCF now refers to the Ops Manager Director by hostname instead of by IP address.
  This corrects an issue where the tile could not communicate with the Ops Manager Director if the IP address changed.

### v0.10.1

**Release Date:** June 15, 2017

 - Corrected a few metric types
 - Scrubbed credentials from logs
 - Tweaked dimensions for app metadata

### v0.10.0

**Release Date:** June 1, 2017

Included in this release:

* Revamp of integration that is now a BOSH release wrapped in a tile instead of a Garden app.

* The JMX Bridge is no longer used, so it can be uninstalled if not used for anything else.

* Now sends container metrics.

### v0.9.1

**Release Date:** May 12, 2017

Due to CVE-2017-4975, this is a rerelease of v0.9.0 to ensure that the new tile
generator is used when building the tile.
