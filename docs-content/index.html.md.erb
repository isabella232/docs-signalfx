<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING:</strong> The SignalFx Monitoring and Alerting tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test
purposes only. Do not use this product in a Pivotal Platform production environment.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
Version 4.20.0-1 of the SignalFx Monitoring and Alerting is a reimplementation
of the old 0.x line of tile releases.  It now includes a SignalFx Smart Agent
BOSH release and buildpack, and a reimplementation of the firehose nozzle that
uses the RLP Gateway instead of the old v1 Loggregator API. If you previously
installed any version of this tile prior to v4.20.0-1, uninstall it and install
the latest version.</p>

This documentation describes the SignalFx Monitoring and Alerting integration
for Pivotal Platform. Use this integration to monitor the health and
performance of your Pivotal Platform deployment using SignalFx. This
integration retrieves metrics about your Pivotal Platform deployment from the
Loggregator Firehose and sends them to SignalFx.  It also provides a buildpack
for the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent) to
run the agent as a sidecar to PWS applications.

SignalFx's integration with Pivotal Platform includes:
